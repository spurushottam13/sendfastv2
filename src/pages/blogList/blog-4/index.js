          How does a simple-to-understand Analytic Dashboard turn life easier?
        </h1>
        <p>
          The feature of the dashboard in any web analytics tool site can let
          you do the data visualization in the simplest possible manner. It
          depends upon the site developers either to provide numerous or few
          dashboards along with the widgets. Popular options like Google
          Analytics are offering twelve widgets for a single view with up to 20
          dashboards. However, this is not an ideal source of getting your
          site’s stats as your visitors’ personal data is stolen by the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          The users usually spend more time on the default dashboard based on
          various icons and related features. Pixel is probably the new name in
          the world of web analytics, but it’s leaving no stone unturned to
          impress the site owners. The site has an amazingly designed dashboard.
          Unlike Google Analytics, Pixel is offering more user-friendly features
          and options for effective results. The dashboard icons included in
          Google Analytics sometimes seem trickier to understand. But Pixel
          doesn’t want to make it all confusing for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          For any person who has created a dashboard on your site, Pixel doesn’t
          let them share any info with someone who signed up recently. The
          shared configurations of the dashboard don’t share any data to keep it
          more secure. You are going to find tons of options despite the
          multiple resharing of dashboards by the people. Here are some
          worth-discussing things that make Pixel’s dashboard stand out in the
          crowd.
        </p>

        <h2>What can you see in a dashboard?</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike other web analytics tools, Pixel seems quite clear about giving
          a superb experience of using the site’s dashboard. It is based on some
          great features that are quite simple to understand and don’t require a
          lot of your time. The site doesn’t let your PC get stuck due to
          frequent loadings and is never going to turn your system slower. The
          following options offered by Pixel related to creating and using the
          dashboard have been designed to keep all of the site’s data protected.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A user can save their time from logging in every time due to the
            daily/weekly email feature. This really sounds great to live a
            hassle-free life and go through all the emails with a single click.
            There is no need to waste your precious hours on the dashboard.
          </li>
          <li>
            Like any high-tech Analytics tool, creating the dashboard and
            handling many other features in it is quite simpler.
          </li>
          <li>
            Widget creation is one of the important tasks included on the site’s
            dashboard. You have multiple options to make your data display view
            more appealing. You would get a particular combination of metrics
            and dimensions to work with depending on the chosen type.
          </li>
          <li>
            You simply have to click on the widget to head to the report you
            want in case of viewing more data.
          </li>
          <li>
            The audience demographics, custom campaigns, top content, traffic
            sources, conversions, and active visitors are some favorites
            included in a site.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It is not possible to compare the data of multiple websites at once.
          For this attempt, you’ll have to move to accounts and properties. It
          is quite a hassle to review the data if you’re managing multiple sites
          for different clients across the world.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Pixel?</h2>
        <p>
          It’s a fact that the compelling display, features, and multiple
          options in a Google Analytics website attract plenty of users on the
          web. However, they all are actually not familiar with the total
          compromise on their data privacy for having such eye-grabbing
          features. On the other hand, Pixel is providing a great experience of
          quantifying your site’s stats without even taking the personal
          information of any single visitor. The newbie site owners mostly can’t
          understand those complex icons and options available on the Google
          Analytics site. Pixel has made everything quite easier and simpler for
          better assessment of the site’s data. It doesn’t require any
          preparation in advance or some prior learning for using the site like
          a pro.
        </p>
        <p>
          All you have to do is go through the site’s FAQs to get all the
          details about every available feature. You can’t even expect to get
          your visitors’ personal info used by this site. You’re going to have
          some amazing features to use this site and get accurate stats without
          losing any personal data. It’s an honorable platform that only earns
          by charging a certain smaller fee and never deceives the users by
          stealing any sort of data from their sites. In short, this platform is
          assuring the peace of mind to the site’s owners that is worth having
          with no doubt.
        </p>

        <h2>Last Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Pixel dashboards would let you create your most important data visual
          shortcuts after signing up straight away. You can select from
          different or your own shared dashboards if you’re ready to kickstart
          on this platform. The best thing about using Pixel is to experience
          all the features without any fear of getting your data used with no
          consent. This web analytics tool also makes every site visitor feel
          satisfied so that they share their personal details without thinking
          twice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The popular alternative of Pixel by Google Inc is providing free
          services but charging a large amount indirectly by selling people’s
          data for targeted advertising. This really seems bad when such a
          bigger name in the web analytics industry cheats on people. The
          company is actually deceiving us all by providing free-of-cost
          services and getting a lot in return. Choosing Pixel for your site’s
          data examination and creating a dashboard can give you a stress-free
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whosoever visits your site would not leave it by sharing all of their
          personal details (which would be sold for developing behavioral
          profiles). Such sites are making billions of dollars through the
          unethical means of stealing the data of site visitors. Now, it’s your
          choice either to choose an option that’s involved in some unethical
          practices or go for Pixel to have a secured platform for site
          analytics. One-time selection can either make you feel totally
          satisfied or end up compromising the privacy of your site’s data.
