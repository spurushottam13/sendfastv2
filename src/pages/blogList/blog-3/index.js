          Don’t Use Google Analytics on your Website: Some Genuine Reasons to
          Avoid
        </h1>
        <p>
          We know Google Inc for all the right reasons. But we’re actually kept
          unfamiliar with some of the things being done by the corporation under
          the curtain. Google has offered an internet analytics service with the
          name Google Analytics. The purpose of this platform is to track
          applications, social networking sites, flash videos, and quantify your
          advertising return on investment. The various types of website
          statistics are measured by this program. The owners of millions of
          websites want to know a lot about their sites’ traffic, and the data
          of those visitors is kept in the record by Google Inc. Let’s have a
          look at some in-depth details about ignoring Google Analytics and
          preferring some trusted options instead.
        </p>

        <h2>Direct Access to Browsing Information and User Data</h2>
        <p>
          If you still think that Google Inc doesn’t have any direct reach to
          your confidential/personal info and browsing data, you’re living in
          the dark. The company has already recorded much data from the web
          traffic’s large part without leaving any hint behind for us. One can
          be easily tracked from different angles and become part of the
          company’s database. There are 9 products offered by the world’s
          largest ad-tech company, and each product has users in billions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google Analytics is used to track the web visitors of around 53
          percent of all websites. Getting access to the personal data of
          innumerable individuals across the globe is quite simple for the
          company. It has built its wealth by gathering personal data of
          individuals in bulk to consume such behavioral and personal insights.
          This is how the company is actually betraying us all by providing
          free-of-cost services and getting a lot in return.
        </p>

        <h2>Creating Behavioral Profiles is a Reason as well</h2>
        <p>
          Who else would want their data to be sold for the purpose of targeted
          advertising? The data relating to places we spend our time at, people
          that we engage with, products that we purchase, topics we search for,
          and sites we visit are used for the same purpose. The behavioral
          profiles are created by using such data, which is then sold by the
          company.
        </p>

        <h2>Slower Site Speed Experience</h2>
        <p>
          You’re going to face additional loading time and page weight on a site
          through web analytics. If you want to make your site fast, lean, and
          less concerned about the most useful site stats, you’ll find the
          Universal Analytics Script and Google’s Global Site Tag bloat. This
          centralized script can let one integrate numerous Google features and
          services (i.e., remarketing and tracking), which is a suggested way of
          Google Analytics integration on your site.
        </p>

        <h2>Requires Permission to Store Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          It is impossible to get access to this web analytics platform with no
          cookies because it’s a cookie-based web tool. This attempt can let
          them track new users during browsing sessions by using the cookies.
          The PECR has something to say about it. They want Google Analytics to
          obtain permission to store cookies on devices and explain what the
          cookies will do.
        </p>

        <h2>The Inaccurate Data and Blocked by Various Browsers and Plugins</h2>
        <p>
          Many users who have ad blockers and others who rely on browsers like
          Brave and Firefox have already blocked Google Analytics. It is even
          unable to perform cross-site tracking due to the blocking by Apple’s
          Safari browser. You don’t need to be surprised to see 50 percent or
          more visitors blocking this tool, as it depends on the audience of the
          site. There are some individuals who have doubts that Google Analytics
          also uses data sampling. This procedure is about examining a data
          subset for unleashing useful information in the bigger sets of data.
        </p>

        <h2>Simple to Understand & Cost-Friendly Alternative</h2>
        <p>
          After going through the various reasons for avoiding Google Analytics,
          one who’s wiser enough would love to switch to any other best option.
          Let’s give you a few minutes to know about Pixel Analytics. While
          developing this web analytics tool, privacy, speed, and
          user-friendliness have been kept in mind. People have been using
          Google Analytics for years and are familiar with its drawbacks. Pixel
          has come up with features to give endless peace of mind to the site
          users. The tool is designed to keep full privacy of visitors, provides
          fast loading sites, and helps the site owners to get access to
          actionable site statistics.
        </p>

        <h2>Pixel - A Quintessential Alternative to Google Analytics</h2>
        <p>
          Your web analytics tool isn’t worth using if it fails to keep the
          personal information of any site’s visitors confidential. Pixel is a
          name of the trusted platform that never gathers any data while
          tracking site stats. The site owners won’t have to be worried about
          granting permission from PECR, CCPA, or GDPR, as this platform doesn’t
          steal personal data. Of course, Pixel isn’t blocked by adblockers, and
          this is something every site owner and visitor wants to hear. It
          offers a smaller script compared to Google Analytics. Therefore, it
          loads faster and weighs much less as a result. It is not a
          free-of-cost platform, as they do not betray people by using their
          personal information and earning through that way unethically. You’ll
          be required to pay a small fee to keep the work going smoothly. It is
          worth every penny as a reliable source of quantifying your site’s
          statistics. It lets you get full ownership of all the information
          gathered from the webpage. The owner is supposed to have control over
          everything, whether the site is hosted on the owner’s servers or its
          own servers.
        </p>

        <h2>The Final Words</h2>
        <p>
          As a site owner, you would never want your web analytics tool to steal
          the personal information of the visitors. The confidentiality of data
          is always a top priority and comes before all other features. Owners
          can focus on making their websites better with all the critical
          information available at a glance by using Pixel. It is quite simple
          to use and doesn’t require any sort of prior training. So, what are
          you waiting for?
